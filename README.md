# CS-250

When listening to client's needs, it's important to not overthink and get caught up in the details. Creating user stories helps with this and it allows us to create a product backlog of them to determine each story priority and how we envision the steps needed to bring this story to life. 

Going forward, I plan on taking an agile-approach when developing programs. I really enjoyed learning how to incorporate Scrum into agile and therefore I see myself using sprints and sprint retrospectives into my development style. I also really liked creating the product backlog and enjoy the organization it provides. 

Being a good team member in software development means to work and grow as a team. If you're struggling on something, let your team know and learn to lean on them. Together you can make a solid and strong foundation.
